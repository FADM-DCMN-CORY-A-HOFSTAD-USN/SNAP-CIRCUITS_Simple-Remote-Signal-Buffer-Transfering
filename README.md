# SNAP-CIRCUITS_Simple-Remote-Signal-Buffer-Transfering
This is a simple circuit that is designed to be broken into two pieces. Each piece contains a double latch gate buffer. The two pieces transfer signal buffers and/or electrical power two-ways over remote distances with unlimited reach. The circuit is simple and designed for large-scale dense manufacturing with strong reliable materials. This circuit was designed by the Criptonian Workers Union (CRIPS) to support remote mission power, communication transfer, computer data trasnmission, etc.
