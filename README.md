# SNAP-CIRCUITS_Simple-Remote-Signal-Buffer-Transfering
This is a simple circuit that is designed to be broken into two pieces. Each piece contains a double latch gate buffer. The two pieces transfer signal buffers and/or electrical power two-ways over remote distances with unlimited reach. The circuit is simple and designed for large-scale dense manufacturing with strong reliable materials. This circuit was designed by the Criptonian Workers Union (CRIPS) to support remote mission power, communication transfer, computer data trasnmission, etc.

Some basic functions:

With a good reader on one half, the other half can send morse code with the touch of a finger.

Can be used with Pessurized Crystal for timing. -Jamoni

Can be used to power SCUBA gear. -Theo

Master P has corrected the uploaded schematic as the latch gates have to face the same direction.
